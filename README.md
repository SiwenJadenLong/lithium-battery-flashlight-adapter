# lithium-battery-flashlight-adapter
Design for converting a flashlight powered by 6 AA batteries for 9v to a rechargable 26650 boosted up to 9v and with built in usb-c charging.

Needs an Output of 9v

space expressed as cylinder:
- 104mm height
- 30.7mm diameter

Stated manufacturer specs:
with 6 AA batteries in series for 9v,
battery life of 2hrs.
Assuming 2AH, that seems like an average continous draw of about 1A

The AA battery holder has 2 pcb plates that interface with the LED and button, I'll be soldering to those to physically connect to the battery.

# Plan:
1.  Create a circular pcb that boosts battery voltage to 9v and allows for usb-c recharging, does not have to do both at the same time.
2. Create 3D printing casing for adapter
3. solder adapter to interface plates that came with flashlight
4. profit?
