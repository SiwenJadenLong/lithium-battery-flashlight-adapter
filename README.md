# lithium-battery-flashlight-adapter
Design that uses a custom pcb and 3D printing for converting a powerful surge brand flashlight powered by 6 AA batteries for 9v to a rechargable 26650 with usb-c charging.

Why?:
I don't like AA batteries :P
and I need a bright flashflight when I'm skating home at night

# Plan:
1.  (WE ARE HERE) Create a circular pcb that boosts battery voltage to 9v and allows for usb-c recharging, does not have to do both at the same time. 
2. Create 3D printing casing for adapter
3. assemble
4. profit?
